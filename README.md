The Fizz Buzz game typically involves the following Python concepts:

Conditional Statements (if-elif-else): Conditional statements are used to check if a number meets certain conditions (e.g., divisible by 3, divisible by 5, or both) and perform corresponding actions.

Loops (for or while): Loops are used to iterate over a sequence of numbers (e.g., from 1 to 100) and apply the Fizz Buzz rules to each number.

Modulus Operator (%): The modulus operator (%) is used to check if a number is divisible by another number without any remainder. This is essential for determining if a number is divisible by 3, 5, or both.

String Concatenation: String concatenation is used to build the output message for each number based on the Fizz Buzz rules.
